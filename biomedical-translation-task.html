<h3>Task description</h3>

<p>This is a new task which aims to evaluate systems on the translation of scientific publications for the the biological and health domains.
The documents were retrieved from the <a href="www.scielo.org">Scielo</a> database of scientific publications.
The biomedical translation task will address the following language pairs:</p>

<ul>
<li> English-French and French-English</li>
<li> English-Spanish and Spanish-English</li>
<li> English-Portuguese and Portuguese-English </li>
</ul>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>We will make available parallel corpora for the above three language pairs, as well as monolingual corpora for each of the four languages.
All documents were retrieved from the Scielo database for both the parallel and the monolingual corpora.
The documents can be composed of either a title, the abstract or both of them, depending on their availability in the database.
Additionally, we will also make available a parallel corpus of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">Medline</a> titles.</p>

<p>Data will be made available in the <a href="http://bioc.sourceforge.net/">BioC format</a>, for which readers and writers are available for 
many programming languages, as well as various natural language processing tools for biomedicine.</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Evaluation will be carried out both automatically and manually.
Automatic evaluation will make use of standard machine translation metrics, such as BLEU and/or METEOR.
Native speakers in each of the languages will manually check the quality of the translation for a small sample of the submissions.
The <a href="http://www.appraise.cf/">Appraise system</a> will be used for this purpose.
