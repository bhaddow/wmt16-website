# wmt16-website
Website for WMT16 - the First Conference on Machine Translation


Please do not edit the website in place. Use the git repository
https://github.com/bhaddow/wmt16-website

The only exception is the data/ directory. Use this for files that 
are too large for github, e.g. training data.
