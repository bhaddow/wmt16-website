      <p><h2>Shared Task: Machine Translation of IT domain</h2></p>

    </center>

<p>The focus of this task is a domain adaptation of MT to the <abbr title="information technologies">IT</abbr> domain and translation of questions and answers.
The motivation is a cross-lingual help service, where user questions (troubleshooting for both hardware and software)
are translated from Portuguese, Spanish, Czech, Dutch and German into English,
and the answers are translated from English back to the users' languages.</p>

<p>The questions usually consist of one sentence, but rarely more, e.g.
 <i>"I cannot receive e-mails. I think my IP's been blacklisted. What should I do?"</i>
and they contain authentic (noisy, informal) language of the users.
The answers are generally longer than the questions (usually one sentence, but sometimes more).
<!--We refer to questions and answers as segments.-->
</p>

<p>
You may participate in any or all of the following language pairs:
<ul>
 <li>German-English (questions)</li>
 <li>English-German (answers)</li>
