      <p><h2>Shared Task: Automatic Post-Editing</h2></p>
      <script src="menu.js"></script>
    </center>

<p> This shared task will examine automatic <b>methods for correcting errors produced by an unknown machine translation (MT) system.</b> 
Since the system itself is a "black-box", automatic post-editing methods have to operate at downstream level 
(that is, after MT decoding), by exploiting knowledge acquired from previous human post-editions and provided as training material.  
</p>

<H3>Goals</H3>

<p>
Automatic Post-editing (APE) aims at improving MT output in black-box scenarios, in which the MT system is used "as is" and cannot be modified. 
From the application point of view APE components would make it possible to:
<UL>
<LI>Cope with systematic errors of an MT system whose decoding process is not accessible</LI>
<LI>Provide professional translators with improved MT output quality to reduce (human) post-editing effort</LI>
<LI>Adapt the output of a general-purpose system to the lexicon/style requested in a specific application domain</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<H3>Task Description</H3> 

<p>In this pilot run of the shared task we will provide you with training (<i>source, target, human post-edition</i>) triples and you will return 
automatic post-editions for unseen (source, target) test pairs.</p>

<H3>Data</H3>
<p><b>To be Announced</b></p>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<p><b>To be Announced</b></p>

<H3>Submission Format</H3>

<p>
The output of your system should produce automatic post-editions of the target sentences in the test in the following way:
<pre>
&lt;METHOD NAME&gt;   &lt;SEGMENT NUMBER&gt;   &lt;APE SEGMENT&gt;
</pre>
</p>

Where:
<ul>
<li><code>METHOD NAME</code> is the name of your automatic post-editing method.</li>
<li><code>SEGMENT NUMBER</code> is the line number of the plain text target file you are post-editing.</li>
<li><code>APE SEGMENT</code> is the automatic post-edition for the particular segment.</li>
</ul>
Each field should be delimited by a single tab character.
</p>

<H3>Submission Requirements</H3>

<p>Each participating team can submit at most 3 systems, but they have to explicitly indicate which of them represents their <i>primary</i> submission. In the case that none of the runs is marked as primary, the latest submission received will be used as the primary submission.</p>

 
<p>Submissions should be sent via email to <font color="red"><a href="mailto:wmt-ape-submission@fbk.eu">wmt-ape-submission@fbk.eu</a></font>. Please use the following pattern to name your files:</p>

<p><code>INSTITUTION-NAME_METHOD-NAME_SUBTYPE</code>, where:</p>

<p><code>INSTITUTION-NAME</code> is an acronym/short name for your institution, e.g. "UniXY"</p>

<p><code>METHOD-NAME</code> is an identifier for your method, e.g. "pt_1_pruned"</p>

<p><code>SUBTYPE</code> indicates whether the submission is primary or contrastive with the two alternative values: <code>PRIMARY</code>, <code>CONTRASTIVE</code>.</p>

<p>You are also invited to submit a short paper (4 to 6 pages) to WMT describing your APE method(s). You are not required to submit a paper if you do not want to. In that case, we ask you to give an appropriate reference describing your method(s) that we can cite in the WMT overview paper.</p>
