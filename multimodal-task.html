      <p><h2>Shared Task: Multimodal Machine Translation</h2></p>
      <script src="menu.js"></script>
    </center>

<p>This is a new shared task aimed at the generation of image descriptions in a target language, given an image and one or more descriptions in a different (source) language. The task can be addressed from two different perspectives:
<ul>
<li>as a <b><a href="#task1">translation task</a></b>, which will take a source language description and translate it into the target language, where this process can be supported by information from the image (multimodal translation), and </li>
<li>as a <b><a href="#task2">description generation task</a></b>, which will take an image and generate a description for it in the target language, where this process can be supported by the source language description (crosslingual image description generation). </li>
</ul>

We welcome participants focusing on either or both of these task variants. They will differ mainly in the training data (see below) and in the way the target language descriptions are evaluated: against one or more translations of the corresponding source description (translation variant) or against one or more descriptions of the same image in the target language, created independently from the corresponding source description (image description variant).   
</li>
This task has the following main <b>goals</b>:

<ul>
<li>To push existing work on the integration of computer vision and language processing. </li>   
<li>To push existing work on multimodal language processing towards multilingual multimodal language processing.</li>
<li>To investigate the effectiveness of information from images in machine translation. </li>
<li>To investigate the effectiveness of crosslingual textual information in image description generation.</li>
</ul>

We will provide new training and test datasets for both variants of the task and also allow participants to use external data and resources (constrained vs unconstrained submissions). The data to be used for both tasks is an extended version of the <a href="http://shannon.cs.illinois.edu/DenotationGraph/">Flickr30K</a> dataset. The original dataset contains 31,783 images from Flickr on various topics and five crowdsourced English descriptions per image, totalling 158,915 English descriptions. This dataset was extended in different ways for each of the subtasks, as discussed below.


<!-- <p><b><font color="red">New</font></b>: -->
<p>The code for the <b>main baseline system</b> for both tasks is available <a href="https://github.com/elliottd/GroundedTranslation">here</a>, following the approach described in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04709">(Elliott et al. 2015)</a>, in particular, the MLM&#10141;LM model (due to several requests). A secondary baseline for both tasks will be a Moses phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained using only the textual training data provided, following the pipeline described <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=moses.baseline">here</a>.

<h3 id="task1"><font color="blue">Task 1: Multimodal Machine Translation</font></h3>

<p>This task consists in translating English sentences that describe an image into German, given the English sentence itself and the image that it describes (or features from this image, if participants chose to). For this task, the Flickr30K Entities dataset was extended in the following way: for each image, one of the English descriptions was selected and manually translated into German by a professional translator. <!--; the translator was not given access to the image -->. 
We will provide most of the resulting parallel data and corresponding images for training, while smaller portions will be used for development and test. 
</p>

<p>As <i><font color="green">training</font></i> and <i><font color="green">development</font></i> data, we provide 29,000 and 1,014 triples respectively, each containing an English source sentence, its German human translation and corresponding image.

<p>As <i><font color="green">test data</font></i>, we provide a new set of 1,000 tuples containing an English description and its corresponding image. <!--<a href="http://www.quest.dcs.shef.ac.uk/wmt16_files_mmt/test-set-en-T1.tar.gz">Download test (text) data</a>.-->

<p><i><font color="green">Evaluation</font></i> will be performed against the German human translation on the test set using standard MT evaluation metrics, with METEOR as the primary metric (lowercased text (with punctuation), both detokenised (primary) and tokenised versions).  We will normalise punctuation in both reference translations and system submissions using this <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/normalize-punctuation.perl">script</a>. 
(Here are some <a href="http://www.quest.dcs.shef.ac.uk/wmt16_files_mmt/wmt16mmt_notes_Task1">additional notes</a> on how we did the evaluation.) We may also include manual evaluation.
<!--<p><b><font color="red">New</font></b>: The METEOR command is the following (e.g. for en-de, using <a href="https://github.com/jhclark/multeval">multeval implementation</a>): 
<p>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">
./multeval.sh eval --refs wmt2016/de_test/reference.ref --hyps-baseline baseline_model/de/generated --hyps-sys1 my_great_model/de_generated --meteor.language de
</font>


<p>For those interested in translating in the inverse direction, i.e., German into English, we can release a test set for that direction. The training and development sets will remain the same, their translation direction can simply be flipped.

-->

<p>This task consists in generating a German sentence that describes an image, given the image itself and one or more descriptions in English. For this task, the Flickr30K Entities dataset was extended in the following way: for each image, five German descriptions were crowdsourced independently from their English versions, and independently from each other. 
Any English-German pair of descriptions for a given image could be considered a comparable translation pair.  We will provide most of the images and associated descriptions for training, while smaller portions will be used for development and test.

<!-- EXTRA STUFF -->

<h3>Additional resources</h3>

<p>We suggest the following <b><font color="green">interesting resources</font></b> that can be used as additional training data for either or both tasks:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/translation-task.html">WMT16 News translation task data</a> for both bilingual (English-German) and monolingual (English or German) data.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities/">Flickr30K Entities</a> dataset: an extension of the Flickr30K dataset which contains additional layers of annotation such as 244K coreference chains in the English descriptions and 276K manually annotated bounding boxes for entities in the images.</li>
<li>Additional image description datasets for source (English) side models, such as the <a href="http://mscoco.org/">Microsoft COCO Dataset</a>, among others. See <a href="http://visionandlanguage.net/">this survey</a>  for a complete list.
</ul>

Submissions using these or any other resources external to those provided for the tasks should indicate that their submissions are of the "unconstrained" type.

<!-- SUBMISSION INFO -->

<h3>Submission Format</h3>

<p> The output of your system <b>a given task</b> should produce a target language description for each image formatted in the following way: </p>
<pre>&lt;METHOD NAME&gt; &lt;IMAGE ID&gt; &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; &lt;TASK&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt;<br><br></pre>
Where:
<ul>
<li><code>METHOD NAME</code> is the name of your method.</li>
<li><code>IMAGE ID</code> is the identifier of the test image.</li>
<li><code>DESCRIPTION</code> is the output generated by your system (either a translation or an independently generated description). </li>
<li><code>TASK</code> is one of the following flags: 1 (for translation task), 2 (for image description task), 3 (for both). The choice here will indicate how your descriptions will be evaluated. Option 3 means they will be evaluated both as a translation task and as an image description task.</li>
<li><code>TYPE</code> is either C or U, where C indicates "constrained", i.e. using only the resources provided by the task organisers, and U indicates "unconstrained".</li>
</ul>
Each field should be delimited by a single tab character.

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

Each participating team can submit at most 2 systems for each of the task variants (so up to 4 submissions). These should be sent
via email to Lucia Specia <a href="mailto:lspecia@gmail.com" target="_blank">lspecia@gmail.com</a>. Please use the following pattern to name your files:
<p>
<code>INSTITUTION-NAME</code>_<code>TASK-NAME</code>_<code>METHOD-NAME</code>_<code>TYPE</code>, where:
<p> <code>INSTITUTION-NAME</code> is an acronym/short name for your institution, e.g. SHEF
<p><code>TASK-NAME</code> is one of the following: 1 (translation), 2 (description), 3 (both).
<p><code>METHOD-NAME</code> is an identifier for your method in case you have multiple methods for the same task, e.g. 2_NeuralTranslation, 2_Moses
<p><code>TYPE</code> is either C or U, where C indicates "constrained", i.e. using only the resources provided by the task organisers, and U indicates "unconstrained".
<p> For instance, a constrained submission from team SHEF for task 2 using method "Moses" could be named SHEF_2_Moses_C.

<p>You are invited to submit a short paper (4 to 6 pages) to WMT
describing your method(s). You are not required to
submit a paper if you do not want to. In that case, we ask you
to provide a summary and/or an appropriate reference describing your method(s) that we can cite
in the WMT overview paper.</p>
